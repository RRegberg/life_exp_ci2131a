# Abstract

Observing the linear relationship between maximum life expectancy and year.

# Life Expectancy Analysis

First, we will clean the data to format for plotting.

```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
data <- gapminder_unfiltered

data %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) %>%
  arrange(year)
```

Next, we will prepare a plot similar to that of Oeppen and Vaupel (2002).
